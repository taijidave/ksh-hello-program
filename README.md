# ksh-hello-program

    -> this is an old-fashioned 'hello'-program, from CLI DrDOS Apple//c days
    (DOS would boot, & leave you at a command-prompt; much cooler to display all disk contents
     with options to display contents of everything)
     
       simply press the number of the file or directory 
       you'd like to see.
